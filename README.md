# Thameem Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains a one-page static portfolio for **Thameem** — a 3rd year BE student (Class of 2027).

## What’s included
- `index.html` — The portfolio page (responsive, dark theme with accent color).
- `Thameem_Resume.pdf` — Resume (placeholder).
- `assets/` — Placeholder images for project screenshots and avatar.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a GitHub account for Thameem if not already available.
2. Create a new repository **named exactly**: `thameem.github.io`
3. Upload all files and folders from this package to the repository root.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages**, choose branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `root`, then Save.
5. Your site will be available at `https://thameem.github.io` within a minute or two.

## Local testing
Open `index.html` directly in your browser to preview. Replace placeholder images in `assets/` with real screenshots and update links (GitHub, projects) as needed.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` to update contact details, project descriptions, and links.
- Add project repositories and change the "GitHub Repo" link to point to real repos.
- Replace `Thameem_Resume.pdf` with his final resume.

If you want, I can also:
- Create real project screenshots from his code.
- Push this repo to GitHub (I can't push on your behalf — but I can prepare everything).
